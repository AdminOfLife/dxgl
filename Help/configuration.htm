    <h1>Configuration</h1>
      Configuration for DXGL can be accessed by opening the &quot;DXGL Config&quot; program in the DXGL program group.  Configuration is as follows:
    <h2><a name="applist" />Applications</h2>
    Lists the applications currently using DXGL.  Also contains a &quot;Global&quot; entry to set default options.
    When a specific application is selected, a gray or filled checkbox or a groupbox set to &quot;(global default)&quot; means that the global setting will be used.
    <h2><a name="add" />Add...</h2>
    Adds an application to the DXGL registry and copies the DXGL ddraw.dll file to its installation folder.  Requires write permission to the installation folder.  
    Windows Vista or later may display a UAC prompt.
    <h2><a name="remove" />Remove</h2>
    Removes the selected application from the DXGL registry and deletes the DXGL ddraw.dll file from its installation folder. Requires write permission to the installation folder.
    Windows Vista or later may display a UAC prompt.
    <h2><a name="vidmode" />Video mode</h2>
    Selects the method to handle video mode changes using the IDirectDraw::SetDisplayMode API.  The following methods are available:
    <h3>Change desktop resolution</h3>
    Changes the resolution of the Windows desktop to match the paramaters of SetDisplayMode.  The function will return an error if an incompatible mode is attempted.
    <h3>Stretch to screen</h3>
    Stretches the primary surface to fill the entire screen.
    <h3>Aspect corrected stretch</h3>
    Scales the primary surface to fit the screen, while preserving the original aspect ratio.
    <h3>Center image on screen</h3>
    Displays the primary surface as an unscaled image in the center of the screen.
    <h3>Stretch if mode not found</h3>
    Attempts to change the desktop resolution.  If the mode is not compatible, chooses the closest mode and stretches the primary to the screen.
    <h3>Scale if mode not found</h3>
    Attempts to change the desktop resolution.  If the mode is not compatible, chooses the closest mode and scales the primary to the screen, preserving aspect ratio.
    <h3>Center if mode not found</h3>
    Attempts to change the desktop resolution.  If the mode is not compatible, chooses the closest mode and displays the primary in the center of the screen.
    <h3>Crop to screen</h3>
    (Experimental) Crops the output to the screen.  Currently in development.
    <h2><a name="sortmodes" />Sort video modes</h2>
    Determines how to sort the video modes returned by IDirectDraw::EnumDisplayModes
    <h3>Use system order</h3>
    Lists modes by the order generated by the system and/or DXGL.
    <h3>Group by color depth</h3>
    Lists modes in groups of color depth, each group sorted by resolution.
    <h3>Group by resolution</h3>
    Lists modes sorted by resolution, with color depths listed in order for each resolution.
    <h2><a name="changedepth" />Change color depth</h2>
    Determines whether to change the color depth of the desktop if requested by the application.  Use only for testing purposes, leave off otherwise.
    <h2><a name="adjustprimary" />Adjust primary resolution</h2>
    If checked, will create a virtual primary buffer at the screen resolution instead of the normal primary resolution.  May cause slowdowns in certain applications or on certain computers.
    Can enhance the resolution of 3D applications (not yet implemented).
    <h2><a name="extramodes" />Add Extra Display Modes</h2>
    If checked, adds additional, mostly low resolution, display modes to the list generated by IDirectDraw::EnumDisplayModes.  Only works if 
    &quot;Video mode&quot; is not set to &quot;Change desktop resolution.&quot;
    <h2><a name="alldepths" />Support All Color Depths</h2>
    If checked, adds 8, 15, 16, 24, and 32-bit color modes if not listed by the system.  Under Windows 8 or above, this will be enabled by default.
    <h2><a name="scaler" />Scaling method</h2>
    Selects the filter to use for scaling the output when the resolution is different than the desktop resolution, 
    as well as for blitting operations.  The following methods are available:
    <h3>Nearest</h3>
    Uses nearest-neighbor scaling.
    <h3>Bilinear</h3>
    Uses bilinear scaling.  Reduces jagged edges, but may create visual artifacts in some applications.  Does not work with 8-bit color except for the full-screen scaling modes.
    <h2><a name="aspect" />Screen aspect ratio</h2>
    Overrides the aspect ratio for "Aspect corrected stretch" and "Scale if mode not found".  Enter as x:y or as a floating point ratio, for example 4:3 or 1.333333, or select a preset from the dropdown list.  Default uses a square pixel ratio.
    <h2><a name="dpiscale" />DPI scaling mode</h2>
    Fixes errors caused by Windows High DPI scaling in Windows Vista and greater.
    <h3>Disabled</h3>
    Disables the DPI scaling fix, unless specified by the program.
    <h3>Enabled</h3>
    Default setting.  Enables the DPI scaling fix during program initialization.
    <h3>Windows AppCompat</h3>
    Sets a compatibility flag to tell Windows to fix High DPI scaling.  Use if Enabled does not work.
    <h2><a name="fullmode">Fullscreen window mode</a></h2>
    Sets the mode to be used when creating a window for fullscreen mode.
    <h3>Exclusive fullscreen</h3>
    Sets the display to fullscreen mode.  For Windows Vista and greater, causes the Windows graphics to be temporarily suspended, giving the GPU exclusive control of the screen.  This mode is the default and may have the best fullscreen performance.
    <h3>Non-exclusive fullscreen</h3>
    Creates a window that fills the screen but tells the display driver not to take exclusive control of the screen.  Try this mode if the application mixes DirectDraw with GDI and some graphics elements are missing.
    In Windows Vista and greater, this mode may have reduced performance, increased lag, or choppy graphics.  In Windows 8 and 8.1, this performance reduction may be significant due to an operating system flaw.
    <h3>Non-resizable window</h3>
    Forces the fullscreen application to display in a floating window.  Please note that some applications may capture the mouse and thus may cause compatibility issues.
    <h3>Resizable window</h3>
    Forces the fullscreen application to display in a floating window that can be resized or maximized.  Please note that some applications may capture the mouse and thus may cause compatibility issues.
    <h3>Borderless window</h3>
    Forces the application to display in a borderless pop-up window.  If the application is not running at the same resolution as the display, the window will be the same size as the application's display resolution.
