<p>
  Scaling method for an optional image scaling pass. This can be used to create a pixelated effect while still preserving the ability to have filtered display scaling.<br />
  In addition, it can be used to set the scaling filter for a postprocess pass, to be implemented in the future.<br />
  The following methods are available:
</p>
<h3>Nearest</h3>
<p>Uses nearest-neighbor scaling.</p>
<h3>Bilinear</h3>
<p>Uses bilinear scaling. 8-bit display modes will always use nearest scaling for this pass.</p>
