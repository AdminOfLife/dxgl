    <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
    <h2>Problem:  DXGL does not load</h2>
    <h3>Cause:  No application profile</h3>
    Solution:  Open "Configure DXGL" and click the Add button.  Browse to your program and double click it.
    <h3>Cause:  System ddraw.dll registered under absolute path</h3>
    Solution:  Open the file dllpaths.reg in the DXGL installation folder.  This will fix initialization for the
    current user.
    <h3>Cause:  Program does not use DirectDraw</h3>
    Solution:  Make sure your program is configured to use DirectDraw or Direct3D up to version 7.
    <h2>Problem:  Program crashes</h2>
    <h3>Cause:  Incompatible Application Compatibility flags in registry</h3>
    Solution:  Browse to the folder where the application is installed.  Right click the program file and click Properties.
    Click the Compatibility tab and make sure no compatibility options are checked.  If this does not solve your problem,
    open Registry Editor and browse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers
    and make sure there is no entry for your program.  If there is, delete the entry.
