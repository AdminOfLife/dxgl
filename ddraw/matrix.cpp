/*

  This is one basic difference between OpenGL and Direct3D. 
  In both coordinate systems, the X and Y axis are as normal. 
  The Y positive axis going upwards and the X positive axis going to the right. 

  However, the two systems differ in their Z-axis implementation. 
  A Left-Handed System, which Direct3D uses, is one where the Z-axis is positive INTO the screen. 
  Take your Left Hand, face the palm upwards with your fingers pointing in the direction of the positive x-axis (to the right), and curl your fingers in the direction of the Y-positive axis (up). Now if you stick your thumb STRAIGHT (like you were giving a sideways "thumbs-up" sign), your thumb is now pointing in the direction of the positive Z-axis.
  
  OpenGL, on the other hand, uses a Right-Handed system, where the positive Z-axis is coming OUT of the screen. 
  Again, to remember this, take your right hand, point your palm upwards and your fingers pointing in the direction of the positive x-axis 
  (to the right). Now curl your fingers up to the direction of the positive y-axis (up), and point your thumb out. It is now pointing in the direction of the positive Z-axis (out)..

  Note: no doc exists how to do the conversion
